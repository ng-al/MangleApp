<div class="transient">
    <p>
        In AngularJS, the <em>service</em> recipes (constant, value, service, factory)
        define objects which will be singletons.
        Controllers that inject those services all receive the same instance of the service.
        Thus, any state that is saved as a property of the service is shared.
    </p>

    <p>
        This mangle <code>apTransient</code> modifies AngularJS so that when you inject a service, you can annotate the
        injection name to declare whether you wish to consume the service as a singleton or transient.
        Assume you have a service named <code>counterService</code> (as below).
        Then when you inject it you can use these forms:
    <ul>
        <li>"controllerService": The service will be injected as a singleton.</li>
        <li>"controllerService as singleton": The service will be injected as a singleton.</li>
        <li>"controllerService as transient": The service will be injected as a distinct instance of the service.</li>
    </ul>
    When you inject a service as a transient, the mangle (in addition to making it transient), will add two properties
    to the object:
    <ul>
        <li>$transientId: A monotonically increasing integer to differentiate between instances.</li>
        <li>$share: A reference to an object that all transient instances of a service can share.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

                These two controllers are using the counterService by injecting it as <code>"counterService"</code>.
                Since counterService is a singleton,
                the value of the <strong>total</strong> property is shared between them.

                When you use transient services, a <code>$share</code> property is defined on the object;
                this property is shared across all instances of the transient service.
                The mangle also adds <code>transientId</code> so that you can distinguish between the different
                instances of a transient service.
